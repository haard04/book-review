# Book Review API

A RESTful API for a Book Review system built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose). Features JWT authentication, book management, reviews, and search.

---

## üöÄ Features
- User registration and login (JWT-based authentication)
- Add, list, and view books (with filters and pagination)
- Submit, update, and delete reviews (one per user per book)
- Search books by title or author (partial, case-insensitive)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT for authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- dotenv for environment variables

## ‚ö° Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repo & install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Copy the example environment file and edit as needed:**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` with your own values.
3. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
   The API will run at `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## üîë Authentication Middleware (Required for protected routes)
Add a file `middleware/auth.js`:
```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No token, authorization denied' });
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Token is not valid' });
  }
};
```
Then, add this middleware to protected routes (e.g., POST /books, review routes):
```js
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');
router.post('/books', auth, bookController.addBook);
// ...
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (Summary)
- **User:** username (unique), email (unique), password (hashed), createdAt
- **Book:** title, author, genre, description, createdAt
- **Review:** user (ref User), book (ref Book), rating (1-5), comment, createdAt
  - Each user can review a book only once

---

## üí° Design Decisions & Assumptions
- JWT is used for stateless authentication; token required for all write operations.
- Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs.
- Pagination defaults: 10 for books, 5 for reviews.
- Reviews are always tied to a user and a book; only the review owner can update/delete.
- Search is case-insensitive and matches partial title/author.
